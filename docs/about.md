A clean, intuitive desktop and sensible defaults so you can start using your system immediately — no steep learning curve.

We ship the newest stable releases of the KDE Plasma desktop environment, even when upstream Ubuntu isn't caught up yet.

🔄 **Rolling Application Updates**

While the OS stays stable, core apps and desktops get timely updates to ensure a fresh and responsive workflow.

Under the hood, the system uses an LTS kernel and Ubuntu’s long-term support base for reliability and wide hardware support.
