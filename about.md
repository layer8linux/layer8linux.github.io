# About Layer8 Linux

Layer8 Linux is designed to make Linux easy for beginners while still offering modern software and a stable core.

## Our Goals
- Beginner-friendly UI and setup
- Latest usable versions of major desktop environments
- LTS kernel for maximum stability
- Easy access to software (Flatpak, AppImage, etc.)

## Why We Exist
Many distros force users to choose between stability and fresh software.  
Layer8 Linux gives you **both**.
